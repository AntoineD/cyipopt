Installation
============

Conda_ is one of the easiest ways to install Python and associated packages for
Linux, Mac, and Windows. Once Conda is installed, you can install cyipopt on
Linux, Mac, and Windows from the Conda Forge channel with::

   $ conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt

The above command will install binary versions of all the necessary
dependencies and cyipopt.
